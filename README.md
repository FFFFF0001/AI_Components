# AI-components
### Introduction
AI parts for Medical form recognition and DNA

### Build everything
Build everything with command
```Bash
make
```
The project strongly relies on functions provided from [Caffe2](https://github.com/caffe2/caffe2) and [Caffe2 C++ helper](https://github.com/breadbread1984/caffe2_cpp_tutorial) . So you need to install these libraries to compile tools in this repo.

### Components
1. Classification base on DNA subsequence. 

You can learn a classifier with train_LSTM. The dataset generation tools will be released soon.
